# String Formatter

A simple string formatting app I came up with to practice building with React, specifically using class based components instead of functional ones w/ hooks.

## Steps

[ x ] Setup basic file/folders structure
[ x ] Setup remote repo on GitHub
[ x ] Setup continuous deployment on Netlify
[ x ] Add basic styles
[ x ] Set output textarea value same as input textarea value
[ ] Keep track of how many checkboxes are checked (allow only 1 to be checked at a time)
[ ] Add logic to "Format" button:

- On click, get input value (if any, display message if empty)
- Check which checkbox is checked (if any, display message if none are checked)
- Apply formatting logic based on checked checkbox
- Display in output box

[ ] Add logic to copy output textarea to clipboard
[ ] Set button text to copied for a few seconds once clicked

## Things I Learned

- Using the useState & useRef hooks to set textarea values
